# 0001-Spartan3A-FX2-breakout

A PCB design to convert the 100 pin Hirose FX2 expansion port of the Digilent Spartan3A Starter Kit to right angle 2.54mm pitch sockets.
Both the Hirose connector and right angle sockets are more expensive than the typical 2.54mm pin headers.  Only one breakout board is needed, cutting down costs on further plugin designs.

Not all 100 pins of the FX2 are used therefore three 10x2 sockets were able to provide all connectivity.
The right angle sockets are placed on a 1.27mm grid, so check and double check your pin header spacing when interfacing to this design.
